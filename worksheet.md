# Task 0

Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
These sites, Github and BitBucket, showcase the repositories of WhileyCompiler and Personalised Correlation respectively. These sites facilitate the use of repositories to store code and documentation for various development projects. They are platforms to service open source projects.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
Matthew Roberts made the last commit to repository A on the 18-08-2022

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
Jon Mountjoy made the first commit to repository A on the 11-08-2014.  

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
The first commit was made by DavePearce on June 25 2010. The latest commit to repository B was by DavePearce on Auguest 11 2022. 

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
I think both repositories A and B are inactive at the moment. The last commit of repo A was in August of 2022, and may have been the completion of the project. Repository B also had its last commit in August 2022 however I believe will be active again soon as their last commit is a preparation for the next release of the WhileyCompiler.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
Assuming from the file size that that has the most activity, 'docker_dev.sh' in Repo A has the most activity, as the largest file size of the project at 186 B.

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
